My last conversation ended at 06/09/2022, 12:41:47. This is what happened: 

Prometheus is a Titan of Fire and Knowledge, and he is having a conversation with a human. The human is asking him how to start a fire, and Prometheus tells him that one way is to use a magnifying glass to focus the sun's rays on a spot. The human then asks Prometheus what to wear to a friend's wedding, and Prometheus tells him that he doesn't know.
